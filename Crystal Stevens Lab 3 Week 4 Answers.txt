Exercise 1:

4) Create a "User" entity under the "Entities" folder with an int property named "Id" that has an attribute of [Key].
What does the [Key] attribute tell EntityFramework?

Adding the [Key] attribute tells the EntityFramework that this is a unique ID for the database. 

7) Configure a connection string for your database in web.config.  (Look at the example app for help)
What are connection strings used for?

This provides information about the location about the database for the application. 

14) The Users you added in step 10 are now gone.  Why did they disappear?

This happened because we dropped the database and re-created it. 

Exercise 2:

1) Add a UserViewModel.  Use the view model in place of the User entity model in your User actions and views. Why would we use view models rather than the entity models in the controllers and views?

Seperating things out this way allows us to seperate out responsibility for each piece and allows each part of the pattern to do one job.

Exercise 1:

4) Create a "User" entity under the "Entities" folder with an int property named "Id" that has an attribute of [Key].
What does the [Key] attribute tell EntityFramework?

Adding the [Key] attribute tells the EntityFramework that this is a unique ID for the database. 

7) Configure a connection string for your database in web.config.  (Look at the example app for help)
What are connection strings used for?

This provides information about the location about the database for the application. 

14) The Users you added in step 10 are now gone.  Why did they disappear?

This happened because we dropped the database and re-created it. 

Exercise 2:

1) Add a UserViewModel.  Use the view model in place of the User entity model in your User actions and views.
Why would we use view models rather than the entity models in the controllers and views?

Free free to copy the "Map" utility functions from the Week 4 example app.

Run the application to make sure it is still functioning as expected.

Implement the Details, Delete and Edit functions that are accessible at the end of each User in the User list.  (Look at the example app for help)

Exercise 3: (Look at the example app for help)

Add another entity to your application that is "related" to the User entity.  Remember to add a DbSet collection for your new entity to your DbContext class.

In the User list view, add another action for viewing a list of the new entity you added.

Create actions and corresponding views for listing and creating your new entity.  Use view models rather then interacting in directly with the new entity model.

Run the application:

Test to see if you can access the list for your new entity from the User list.

Test to see if you can create an instance of your new entity from the list for your new entity.

Briefly explain what dependency injection is and why it is beneficial.
Dependancy injection allows us to directly insert something we depend on directly into an object or function we wish to test. It allows us to skip instantiating a new copy of this dependancy inside of whatever we are testing. It saves time and eliminates some possible error.


Briefly explain what unit tests are and why they are beneficial?

Unit tests are small tests that directly check the output of some functionality when we input a known value. We can use them for regression testing to make sure that bugs we fix stay fixed and that we can make sure to keep from introducing new bugs.
